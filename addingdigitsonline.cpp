// This problem looks difficult at the first glance because of the input ranges are large for the given three integers. Using bruteforce to print all possibilities/combination is difficult, but the problem states that only print one possibility is enough.

// Therefore, it is only needed to loop ten possibilities (0 to 9) on the right of the number a to check if it is divisible by number b. If yes, we just need to print a, followed by this digit and n â€“ 1 times of zeros because this number is also divisible by b.

// If none combination of the number a * 10 + x where x is from 0 to 9, divisible by b, we just print -1.
